# TheBestBlackJackTheWorldHasSeen

A server application developed in the weekend, at the end of the 7th week of <AC_> 64th bootcamp (LOOPeytunes), after less than 2 weeks learning about concurrent network programming, namely concurrency and threads. 


## The idea

Our project was based on the blackjack game, where the server side contains all the game logic and handles the players request, while the client side enables the players to connect to the server, send requests and receive outputs, such as scores and cards. 

Each play

er needs the client jar to play the game, while a computer needs to have the server jar in order to connect to all the players. 


## Development

After the project's approval in Friday before the weekend, we divided the group in two teams:

 * The first team was responsible for developing the server side and game logic.

 * The second team was responsible for developing the client side and client connection.


## Technologies

Java, prompt library
